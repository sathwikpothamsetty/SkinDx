# SkinDx - AI Powered Skin Diagnosis

## Overview
Welcome to **SkinDx**, an AI-powered skin disease detection and information platform! Our goal is to help users identify and understand various skin conditions, with a special focus on common issues prevalent in India, such as **eczema, psoriasis, fungal infections, and pigmentation disorders**.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset & Model Training**
   - We utilized a **dataset from Kaggle** containing diverse skin disease images.
   - A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model** was trained to analyze patterns in these images and learn how to classify different skin conditions.

2. **Image Analysis & Prediction**
   - Users can **upload an image** of their skin condition.
   - The **trained model** analyzes the image based on its learned patterns and predicts the **most probable disease**.
   - The model also provides a **confidence percentage** for the detected condition.

3. **Integrated AI Chatbot**
   - To help users learn more about detected diseases, we integrated an **AI-powered chatbot**.
   - Users can **enter a disease name** to receive detailed information about symptoms, causes, and treatment options.

## Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras (CNN model)
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Skin Disease Dataset
- **Backend**: Flask/FastAPI for ML model integration
- **Frontend**: React/HTML-CSS for user interface
- **AI Chatbot**: NLP-based chatbot for disease information

## Features
✔ **AI-powered skin disease detection**  
✔ **Confidence percentage for predictions**  
✔ **Easy image upload for diagnosis**  
✔ **Integrated chatbot for detailed disease information**  
✔ **Focus on common skin issues in India**  

## How to Use SkinDx
1. **Upload an image** of the affected skin area.
2. The AI model will **analyze the image** and provide a diagnosis with confidence levels.
3. To learn more, enter the **disease name in the chatbot**, and get detailed information instantly.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the dataset for more accurate results.
- Implementing real-time doctor consultations.
- Enhancing chatbot capabilities with more in-depth medical knowledge.
